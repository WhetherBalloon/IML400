   The User Experience for this site is crafted around the idea that users come here for the sole purpose of viewing something they already know exists and is hosted here. Therefore, there is no reason to direct the user to click on something that they don't know exists. It is in the best interest of design for the menue to be visible at all times. So I chose a simple black on grey style, and postioned everything to be at the center of the page - where statistically a user maintains the majority of their concentration.

      The minimalist aesthetic is in part due to modern popular culture, but also to facilitate the simple and direct navigation explained above. However, I chose a dirtier color scheme without the simple contrast of very bright to very dark (ex. white and black) as a tongue in cheek reference to when websites were simple and direct out of neccessaty and inability to do something different.
