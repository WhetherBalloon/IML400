    WEEK 1/2?
    The internet is not an ecosystem - that is to say that all of its information does not exist in one place. Instead, a system of smaller places hold pieces that when activated in a certain order creates the ecosystem for a brief instance. It is in these instances, as I agree with the article, that periods of organization are created due to the effect that a sequence is created. It is self regulating in that much of a popular based system votes that which is unliked to the bottom and that which is liked to the top. Popular stuff becomes culture, culture dictates what popular stuff to maintain. In a way, I believe that this serves to balance the system based purely off the mechanic that the internet will cannot live in a passive state. This is because all of the information is stored on servers that need funds to be accessed via broadband netword. Sure, all the information will not cease to exist unless smashed by a hammer - but the internet - the active organism that allows anyone to access it will. Due to this any superfluous information - things that are not liked, look bad or are outdated are quickly deleted or shoved so far down that no one can find it. This popular feeding frenzy intensifies and speeds the process of art and creativity. Where in the normal world eras and models of art tend to take a while to evolve - art that exists on the internt evolves quickly sometimes so rapidly that its initial orginis are unknown.
