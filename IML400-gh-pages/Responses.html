    WEEK 1/2? - 
    The internet is not an ecosystem - that is to say that all of its information does not exist in one place. Instead, a system of smaller places hold pieces that when activated in a certain order creates the ecosystem for a brief instance. It is in these instances, as I agree with the article, that periods of organization are created due to the effect that a sequence is created. It is self regulating in that much of a popular based system votes that which is unliked to the bottom and that which is liked to the top. Popular stuff becomes culture, culture dictates what popular stuff to maintain. In a way, I believe that this serves to balance the system based purely off the mechanic that the internet will cannot live in a passive state. This is because all of the information is stored on servers that need funds to be accessed via broadband netword. Sure, all the information will not cease to exist unless smashed by a hammer - but the internet - the active organism that allows anyone to access it will. Due to this any superfluous information - things that are not liked, look bad or are outdated are quickly deleted or shoved so far down that no one can find it. This popular feeding frenzy intensifies and speeds the process of art and creativity. Where in the normal world eras and models of art tend to take a while to evolve - art that exists on the internt evolves quickly sometimes so rapidly that its initial orginis are unknown.

      WEEK 3 - 
      This articles is a detailed, if oudated, synopsis of how theoretically the internet - and that sort of information connectivity, works. It eplain this process through the system of W3. W3 is the protocol for which URL, markup language, and server protocol is "stored." In other words, it is a catergorization of a kind of internet access. Despite its techinical direction I find this articler interesting because of its dated assumption of what the internet will do. While now, with the 20/20 vision afforded to use by looking into the past, we can see that not only did the internet fullfil its main purpose, a system of data sharing across isolated locations, but it created a new means of sharing culture and basic human information. This phenonmenon, which occured after the invention of the radio and then again after the invention of the radio, is not predicted in the article. Instead, the ability to access data hubs and folders on servers is told as the height of possible potential for the whole system. In this age, simply interacting with the internet on a passive level involves culture intergration - it is very much like visiting a distance country. Simply put this article demonstrates the ability for lightspeed communication to not only supras expectations but also forge new ones.
