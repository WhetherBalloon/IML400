    WEEK 1: ASTHETICS OF THE INTERNET - The Internet is a ecosystem of different organisms that are not biological like in natures ecosystem but rather central information hubs where data is stored and accessed independent of the location of the person accessing it. Due to its structure, art, games, and other mediums can be hosted and accessed on the internet again independent of location. Since such subjects can be found and created on the internet - it developes its own culture both dependent and independent of the people using the internet. It becomes its own massive location where art is created and stored - much like Florence was back during the renessaince. Because of all this input the internet developes its own taste. Now I would like ot clarify that regardless of the unique culture the internet developes, or the centricity of its ability to host and provide access to such cultural representations (art, music, memes), the internet is not in itself some end all be all culture such as you would find with any isolated civilization. Instead, whats popular exists as a trend along side other things - sometimes completely unrelated - that are also popular. This effect allows sheer massive volumes of information to be stored and readly availible in a somewhat random, perhaps chaotic, system. However, the internet also provides an excellent system of classification by doing this in that it has a feedback loop that continually shifts unpopular, irrelavant things to the bottom, and popular relevant things to the top. This allows it to be both chaotic and tranquil at the same time, ironic - but true.

      WEEK 2: THE WORLD WIDE WEB -
      This articles is a detailed, if outdated, synopsis of how theoretically the internet - and that sort of information connectivity, works. It explain this process through the system of W3. W3 is the protocol for which URL, markup language, and server protocol is "stored." In other words, it is a categorization of a kind of internet access. Despite its technical direction I find this article interesting because of its dated assumption of what the internet will do. While now, with the 20/20 vision afforded to use by looking into the past, we can see that not only did the internet fulfil its main purpose, a system of data sharing across isolated locations, but it created a new means of sharing culture and basic human information. This phenomenon, which occurred after the invention of the radio and then again after the invention of the radio, is not predicted in the article. Instead, the ability to access data hubs and folders on servers is told as the height of possible potential for the whole system. In this age, simply interacting with the internet on a passive level involves culture integration - it is very much like visiting a distance country. Simply put this article demonstrates the ability for lightspeed communication to not only surpass expectations but also forge new ones.

      WEEK 3: UX - User experience is in simple form: all about the user being able to navigate and use a website. However, how to craft the UX is based upon what the wants to do with the website. To this, the developer must understand the point of the website. If it is a social networking site than the user must be able to understand the layout and navigate through all its interation. If the purpose of the site is to provide information than the user must know where the information is stored as quickly as possible. All of this facilitates a simple experinece where the user can exist on the website and use it without noticing they are doing so. Its as simple as that, the user must not feel like they are using the website - but must reap from it all that the website can provide. This can be done through simple color schemes that direct the users eye, or through interactive elements that provide easier access to information.

      THE INTERNET AS ART - Art is this sense seems more disruptive. As in asking the question "how can we take the norm, and what people believe to be the norm, and turn it around." The examples in the artilce ranging from the 404 error project to the mementomori-0.net seems to seek to take the user out of the interactive experience and make them realize that they are in fact submersed in the internet and have been tunnel-visioned for quiet sometime. As in most cases, once something becomes structure there are those who find it pleasurable and educational to find ways of deconstructing it. Internat art seems to be one possible form of deconstruction. The only difference is that this deconstruction, given the fluidity and adaptability of the internet, has the potential to explore new features, uses and reasons behind the internet and the interactions that humans play on any given moment.
